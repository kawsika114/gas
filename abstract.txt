The gas spillage causes the wastage of the gas and mainly as its combustible 
veritable can harm the living thing and other property. To beat such a scene, we 
are developing a system by using raspberry pi to monitor and control of gas 
spillage. This will prompt the customer about the spillage and take the security 
measures in a brief moment. The customer is informed about the gas leakage by 
using Internet Iot app which is communicated with the help of WiFi modem 
attached with the raspberry pi.

industries and other places as it is very convenient, affordable and ecofriendly
and less hazardous than its other alternatives. It has proven to be one of the
